This is a Free Cities-like slave management game re written in pure javascript.  None of the original Free Cities content or world building has been used here, just the general gameplay cycle.

Contributions welcome.  Pull requests accepted, or if you want to add events without any coding required, [go here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ibrLMlGqY2rc-ExmQkWJW3Xr92k0GARphWvWWXp5cN4/edit?usp=sharing).  See FFA if you'd like to discuss other additions; most kinks welcome.

Things that will not be added because they take too much coding effort:
- incest
- pregnancy/breeding
- speech impediments/accents

There's a lot of stuff that isn't fleshed out much yet.  Priorities are:
- buttons for one-on-one interactions between player and slave outside of events
- more events, especially event plot sequences
- effects from buildings (ie, build a bath house and get the ability to change slave hair color; build a kitchen and unlock new events, etc)

[Play in browser](https://a-very-old-sock.github.io/fcalike/) NSFW text, no NSFW images.  The game will set a cookie to store your game information; this means you will not be able to access the same game on a different device.  Formatting on mobile is generally not great right now.
